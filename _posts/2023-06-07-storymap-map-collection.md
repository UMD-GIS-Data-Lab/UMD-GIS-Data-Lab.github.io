The McKeldin Map Collection StoryMaps includes one collection guide and 14 categories of maps. Each category contains an introduction to the map type, some sample map displays, locations at the map collection, and some additional resources.

<!-- This theme supports **link posts**, made famous by John Gruber. To use, just add `link: http://url-you-want-linked` to the post's YAML front matter and you're done. -->
