This map may appear to be a “night” view of the U.S., but it is really just a map showing population density and distribution from the 2010 census.  The irregularly shaped white areas are the urbanized areas of the U.S. as defined at that census – i.e., the larger cities and built-up suburbs around them.  The Boston – Washington East Coast ‘Megalopolis’ is easy to see, and similar (but smaller) urbanized regions can be seen along the Florida coasts, the Chicago-Milwaukee area on the SW shore of Lake Michigan, the greater Los Angeles area in southern California, etc.  The fairly large blob about halfway between Chicago and the Florida Keys is Atlanta (in the 1970s, the Atlanta metropolitan area included only 5 counties – today it covers 29 counties).  The smaller dots are smaller communities and isolated areas of rural settlement.
